# Basic Logistic Regression for MR

## Logistic Regression Classifier in Python - Basic Introduction
In logistic regression... basically, you are performing linear regression but applying a sigmoid function for the outcome.

### Sigmoid / Logistic Function
𝑝=1/1+𝑒−𝑦 

### Properties of Logistic Regression
The dependent variable follows a Bernoulli Distribution
Estimation is maximum likelihood estimation (MLE)

### Advantages
Straight forward, easy to implement, doesn't require high compute power, easy to interpret, used widely.
Doesn't require feature scaling and provides a probability score for observations.

### Disadvantages
Not able to handle a large number of category features/variables.
Vulnerable to overfitting.
### Data
Is the candy chocolate? Let's find out because... yum
